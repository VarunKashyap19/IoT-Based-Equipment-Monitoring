# IoT-Based-Equipment-Monitoring
A Practical Approach with ESP32, InfluxDB, and Machine Learning

This project introduces a smart IoT-based system designed for real-time monitoring of industrial equipment. The system aims to tackle challenges such as unexpected equipment failures, high maintenance costs, and inefficient resource utilization by combining advanced IoT technologies with machine learning. Below is an overview of its components and functionality:

# Key Features
  * Real-Time Monitoring: The system collects data on critical parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and vibration, allowing real-time insights into equipment     performance.
  * Predictive Maintenance: A machine learning model analyzes sensor data to predict equipment conditions, enabling timely interventions to prevent failures.
  * Cloud Integration: Sensor data is stored in InfluxDB, a high-performance cloud database, ensuring scalability, reliability, and ease of access.
    The system utilizes DHT11 sensors to measure temperature and humidity, while a PIR sensor mimics vibration detection to monitor equipment health. Data is       
    processed by an ESP32 microcontroller and transmitted wirelessly to the cloud for storage and analysis.

# System Architecture
  * Sensing Layer:
    Equipped with sensors to collect real-world data (e.g., temperature, humidity, and vibration signals).
    DHT11 and PIR sensors are used for environmental and equipment monitoring.
  * Fog Layer:
    The ESP32 microcontroller processes raw sensor data locally and filters out noise before transmitting it to the cloud.
  * Cloud Layer:
    InfluxDB organizes and stores data, enabling advanced analytics and integration with machine learning models.
  * Application Layer:
    A machine learning model, deployed on Google Colab, analyzes the data to provide actionable insights, displayed via a user-friendly dashboard.

# Results
The machine learning model, based on Random Forest, achieved an accuracy of 82% in predicting equipment conditions, classifying them as Normal, Needs Maintenance, or Faulty. Temperature and humidity proved to be the most influential features, contributing 45% and 40%, respectively, to the predictions, while vibration signals contributed 15%.

# Future Enhancements
The project has demonstrated significant potential, but future iterations could include:
  * Adding more sensor types, such as vibration or pressure sensors, for comprehensive monitoring.
  * Using advanced machine learning models like neural networks for improved prediction accuracy.
  * Incorporating temporal data to capture trends over time for better fault detection.

// This project exemplifies the fusion of IoT and AI to revolutionize industrial monitoring, making operations smarter, more sustainable, and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards.
